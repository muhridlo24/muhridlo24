### I am Muhammad Ridlo, a data science and entrepreneurship enthusiast with a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), one of the top universities in Indonesia. I am certified in various data science topics by DataCamp, such as machine learning, time series analysis, and supervised learning with scikit-learn. I published a journal article on the influence of slang language among college students in Indonesia, using qualitative analysis with Python.
